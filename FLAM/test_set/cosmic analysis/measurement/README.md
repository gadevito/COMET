# FIDDIA measurement dataset
The `measurement` directory contains 4 files, which represent the automatic and manual measurement of the FIDDIA functional processes.
Each file name starts with a number (i.e., `1_measurement.xlsx`), representing the funcational process measurement, and contains three sheets:
- `Measurement`, contains the manual and COMET analysis of the functional process.
- `Triggering event`, contains the Triggering Event manually identified comparated to the COMET's one.
- `FU`, contains the Functional User (starting the Functional Process) manually identified comparated to the COMET's one.
