UC-PRE-03.0	Blocked rooms management
Description	Rooms are blocked at the time of booking and will remain in that state for a certain period set by the hotel manager. After this period, the system shall inform the user that the room has been blocked for too long. Therefore, the user can find out if the delay is due to a customer's mishap or if he (or she) no longer intends to stay in the hotel. Once the customer's deposit has arrived, it must be possible to switch the room from blocked to assigned. In the first case, the blocking of the room will be renewed, while in the second case, the reservation will be canceled. This function inserts in the Blocked Rooms Warnings file the reservations that have to be processed by the Hotel Manager.
