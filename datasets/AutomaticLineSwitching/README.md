# Automatic Line Switching dataset
The `AutomaticLineSwitching` directory contains the Automatic Line Switching use case model (`AutomaticLineSwitching-UC.docx`). It is a COSMIC case study, therefore its measurement is at the following URL https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/automatic-line-switching-v1-1/. 
It has the following sub-folders:
- `FP_prompts`, contains the prompts used for each use case
- `measurement`, contains the manual and COMET result for each use case
