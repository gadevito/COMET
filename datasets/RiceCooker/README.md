# Rice cooker dataset
The `Rice cooker` directory contains the Rice cooker use case model (`Rice cooker-UC.docx`). It is a COSMIC case study, therefore its measurement is at the following URL https://cosmic-sizing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Rice-Cooker-2.0.1-GoogleDocs.pdf. 
It has the following sub-folders:
- `FP_prompts`, contains the prompts used for each use case
- `measurement`, contains the manual and COMET result for each use case
