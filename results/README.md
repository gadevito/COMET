# Results
The `results` directory contains the results of the empirical evaluation of COMET. It contains the following files.
`MIS.xlsx`: 
It contains the results of the evaluation of COMET in the MIS domain. It has three sheets:
- Summary, which contains the summary of the results in terms of total functional process, use cases and CFPs, average duration of the execution of COMET per Functional Process and the total duration. It also contains the summary of the 1-Rouge and BLEU metrics.
- Metrics, which contains the metrics detail for each functional process.
- Duration, it contains the duration stats of the execution of the COMET approach.

`Summary.xlsx`: 
It reports the summary of the COMET evaluation in terms of 1-Rouge and BLEU metrics and the details of participants' answers to Questionnaires no.1 and 2.

`RQ3_time.xlsx`: 
It contains the results of the evaluation of COMET in reducing the measurement time (RQ3).
It has 7 sheets:
- Summary, which reports the summary of the evaluation.
- Time FP1, ..., Time FP5, which report the duration measured by the seven participants for the five functional process of the FID-TCT application.
- Fine-tuning time, which reports the time recorded by the seven participants to fine-tune the COMET analysis.
